## Pages

### Home

Home page, for now, just displays some lorem ipsum text.
Finally getting the hang of git.
Here's the code we used:
``` html
      <section>
        <div class="jumbotron">
          <img src="./images/jumbotron.jpg" />
        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p>
            lorem ipsum text went here
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
